# Image-Carousel
The Git repository contains a project that implements a CSS framework and a dynamic image carousel. The CSS framework provides several mixins for styling elements, including alerts, buttons, cards, forms, and layout utilities. These mixins can be used to easily apply consistent and customizable styles to different components of a website or web application.

The dynamic image carousel utilizes the Swiper library to create a slideshow of random images fetched from the Unsplash API. The carousel automatically advances every 2 seconds, and users can navigate through the images using the next and previous buttons. The carousel is responsive and supports infinite looping of the images.

This project can serve as a starting point for building websites or applications with a pre-defined CSS framework and a dynamic image carousel feature. Developers can leverage the provided mixins to quickly style their components and easily incorporate a visually appealing image slideshow into their projects.

The repository includes the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to run the project. Additionally, it demonstrates the usage of external libraries, such as Swiper and fetch API, to enhance the functionality and visual experience of the image carousel.

Overall, this Git repository offers a valuable resource for developers looking to incorporate a CSS framework and a dynamic image carousel into their projects efficiently and effectively.
